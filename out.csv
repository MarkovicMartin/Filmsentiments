6 October 2021,Peter_Young,6," An enjoyable adaptation of a classic tale, though could have been better
","Based on the famous folk tale from One Thousand and One Nights, this film is a nice co-production between India and USSR and it's a very enjoyable film despite the fact that several of the leading actors in it are quite miscast, starting with Dharmendra in the title role. The story obviously makes up for many of its possible flaws given how good it is to begin with, and the film is well made in terms of execution, setting, and art direction. The script deviates from the original tale quite a bit, but I don't think anyone would mind it, it is its draggy narrative that takes it down. In its favour, once it picks up it gets relatively better, and the film is further enhanced by the wonderful music of R. D. Burman, with the famous ""Khatouba"" in Asha Bhosle's excellent rendition topping them all. Dharmendra despite not being the best choice for the part is quite good, so is Hema Malini, while Zeenat Aman does better as Fatima. The film is overloaded with stereotypical villains but for once it is good because that's what such a fairy tale calls for, and it works. While a little long and requires patience at times, it is still nice, wholesome entertainment.",/review/rw2121690/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2014,khayaal_e_yaar,8," A wonderful journey to the age old classic cinema
","I seldom review 'fairy tales' because of their speculative nature. Such tales usually take me to an imaginary world for an hour or two and when their effect fizzles out, I realize that it didn't work on me as it should have. However, this isn't the case with 'Alibaba Aur 40 Chor' released in the year 1979 or 1980. It was a collaborative effort between India and USSR. It was a film directed jointly by Umesh Mehra and Latif Faiziev. The duo would also direct 'Sohni Mahiwal' in 1984, yet another milestone with evergreen songs. Since 'Alibaba Aur 40 Chor' is a 3 hour film, we would better look at the characters and their parts in this film.",/review/rw2121690/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2009,suchenwi,8," Exciting Soviet Bolly
","Wow, is this a fascinating movie. Made in 1979 as Uzbek/Indian co-production, it covers classic Bollywood elements (well-done song&dance numbers, elephants, family relations) as well as Soviet themes (the chief robber doubling as Vezir, the plight for water - not as a priced commodity, etc.) In fact, the topic of water runs throughout this film - from drops in a bottle to destruction and reconstruction of a vital dam. (Not to forget the waterfall in front of the cave...) In addition, you get heroic fathers and mothers, really eerie villains, and all in all a jolly good yarn.",/review/rw2121690/?ref_=tt_urv
